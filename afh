You want my gun, my firearm? Come take it from me! Just walk through my door, come into my home, and take it from me! With your weak, soft, girlish, liberal hands Just try to put those hands on me, those soft, liberal hands, put them on me!
On my body Just slowly, gently dragging your fingers up and down my arm giving me goose bumps You want my gun? Come kiss me for it!
But, not like right away, don't be too obvious with it Let's do that thing where our faces get close to each other and you know it's gonna happen, its just a matter of time You just stare at each other's lips, but you're waiting for the right signal to give yourself over to them completely, like in A Walk to Remember Come do that for my gun!
Bite my lip, and play with my hair, for my firearm!
If you want my gun, come spank me for it! Not like too hard but like still hard, you know? Like hurt me, but make me feel safe at the same time, you pussy liberals!
